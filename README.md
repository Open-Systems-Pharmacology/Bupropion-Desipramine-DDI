# Bupropion-Desipramine-DDI
Modeling of published bupropion-desipramine-DDI studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim model file containing simulations of all published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the bupropion and desipramine models regarding bupropion-desipramine-DDIs, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied bupropion model has been published previously [1] and was adapted to include down-regulation and competitive inhibition of CYP2D6. 

For further details and documentation please refer to [2].
